# Data-Dashboard 
A single page website has been built to showcase a data dashboard that analyses 1,000 students exam performance in Math, Reading & Writing. The dashboard is very important to understand how the students are performing, to determine best practices that can be shared with new students about to take the same exam and for teachers to help plan future curriculum. 

The page uses the D3.js library with the DC.js and crossfilter.js libraries to present the data via a series of scatter plots, pie charts, bar charts and line charts. The graphical arrangement has been designed allow the user to quickly understand a summary of student performance and then backed up with interesting data analysis to reach meaningful hypothesis. Furthermore, there is sufficient data to perform correlation testing to further understand the significance of the exam results.
 
Intriguingly, the user can opt to adapt their view of student data by all, individual or custom data element selection via dropdown list function.

## UXD Considerations
The dashboard has been designed to allow the user to analyse student exam results data through selecting dropdown box options, hovering their cursor over data legend, clicking on charts or just observing the default data summary. 

Furthermore, the user is able to understand potential influences on exam results, such as gender participation, parental education, ethnic groupings, food consumption habits and students’ exam preparation.  

In summary, the user will have a good understanding of how all 1,000 students performed in their respective exams for Maths, Reading and Writing. The dashboard is both intuitive and interactive,  enabling the user to take full control of the source data via the carefully selected manual and automated navigation functions. 

### User & Business Objectives

### Features
#### Feature 1 - Headline title bar with reset data button

•	Headline bar informs signposts user to the dashboard and when clicked, the user will return to the top of the dashboard. In addition, a reset button is available for the user to click to return all data & charts to their default values

•	For ease of navigation, the headline bar is fixed at the dashboard top to help the user quickly find the rest button or automatically move to the top, whilst scrolling through to the bottom  

#### Feature 2 - Introduction

•	Information to the user that provides a basic instruction on how to use the dashboard, brief background on data used and a link to source of original data sample via www.kaggle.com 

#### Feature 3 - Filter by student

•	Single student exam performance can be reviewed by clicking on the ID code that appears in a dropdown box. Student ID range from 1 to 1000. Their respective exam performance can then be viewed in the array of graphical analysis

#### Feature 4 - Filter by gender

•	Total student population contained within data sample can be viewed via a female / male lens. A dropdown box has been designed to create a filter on gender type, together with a total gender count. Furthermore, the user will receive an instant percentage split on gender activity, on both unfiltered and filtered data analysis    

#### Feature 5 - Composite line graph 

•	Math, reading and writing exam results for 1,000 students appear in the form of a line graph. This chart can be viewed in multiple dimensions, depending on how the user has configured dropdown boxes and data filters. By hovering the cursor over the legend, the user will receive a bespoke view of a single subject. Furthermore, the user can hover over the data plot to understand an individual student exam score 

#### Feature 6 - Scatter chart x3 

•	3 scatter plot charts have been designed to initiate regression analysis of all exam subjects. Combinations include math vs reading, reading vs writing & math vs writing. Again, these charts can be viewed in multiple dimensions, depending on how the user has configured dropdown boxes and data filters. The user will certainly get a quick and clear view of how the exam subjects correlate with each other 

#### Feature 7 - Bar chart x2 

•	Ethnicity origin and the distribution over 5 groups’ is the focus of the 1st bar chart. The view of the chart can be altered by either clicking on a selected bar(s) &/or the user can configure the bar chart through work completed to configure other dropdown boxes and data filters

•	Parents educational background distributed over 6 levels of academia is the focus of the 2nd bar chart. The same functionality exists, as with 1st bar chart. The user can look to create some interesting data configurations to see if either ethnicity &/or students parental education has any bearing upon the students’ exam results  

#### Feature 8 - Pie chart x2 

•	Lunch funding is the focus of the 1st pie chart. The influence of a standard lunch allowance or reduced/free lunch allowance can be evaluated by either clicking on a selected pie section(s) &/or the user can configure the pie chart through work completed to configure other dropdown boxes and data filters

•	Student preparation for their exams is the focus of the 2nd pie chart. The options are binary, either the student did or did not prepare for their exams. The same functionality exists, as with 1st pie chart. The user can look to create further interesting data configurations to see if either lunch funding &/or students exam preparation has any bearing upon the students’ exam results  

#### Feature 9 - Collapse / re-open articles 

•	All articles can collapse and re-open, by clicking a blue chevron icon positioned at the top right corner of each article. The chevron becomes inverted upon collapse of the article 

•	Valuable screen space is freed up by closing articles that may not feature in a given data analysis configuration

#### Feature 10 - Footer 

•	Provides a social media link to LinkedIn and a link to my GitHub page. Fonts (glythicons) secured from bootstrap / font awesome. The links are wired to the website designers’ respective social media sites. A .hover pseudo class has been used to provide a background colour change (white to corporate colour code) and font colour change too.   

#### Feature 11 - 404 alert page

•	Provides a friendly sign post for the user in the event an incorrect link has been clicked and the user has the option to click back into a correct link

***
### Features left to implement

###### Amalgamate graphs

•	Scatter plots to move from 3 to 1 by creating a dropdown box to control data plots on show, per exam subject. Bar chart & Pie Chart data to possible merge by creating bar charts with multiple axis. This will provide the user an increased richness of data analysis, through reduced number of graphs

##### Exam Performance Summary

•  	Automate an exam performance summary by publishing an overall average exam score, per subject and a score range, per subject. The scope can be increased by publishing individual student results, once the student selector dropdown box had been clicked and with crossfilter, the exam summary data could be viewed at a demographic level i.e. ethnicity, exam preparations, etc

### Testing

A combination of automated and manual testing processes was applied to this project
to ensure the UXD was upheld by making sure the data was correctly loaded, graphical
charts would be successfully rendered and data filters would accurately enable the user
to navigate through student and gender data attributes.  

The software has been thoroughly tested in many ways. JavaScript and its associated functions have all undergone extensive manual testing.  JS hint was used to help validate the Javascript code. 

Chrome dev tools provided one issue where all charts were not being rendered. The dc.min.css file included a default coding position of ‘float: left. To fix this bug, ‘float: none!important’ was added to style.css file. 

Furthermore, the software has been tested against all user expectations that were set out in UX section above. All possible user actions were mimicked to put the tester in the shoes of the user.  Data was compared by minimizing certain sections, filter the specific data and reset all the filters. The whole data manipulation experience was intuitive and enables both the tester and user to efficiently analyse the data and draw meaningful conclusions. 

#### 1. Jasmine Testing

Jasmine was used to test 4 things in particular for this project:

•	That the data loaded for the project

•	Data filters to show selected source data only

•	Exam score data was verified 

•	Defensive programming using SpyOn() to see if getFocused method gets called. The Spyon() was used as the method() already exists on the object

•	All tests passed in Jasmine

#### 2. Manual Testing

Testing for this project was completed on Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari & Opera browsers.
Responsiveness and correct displaying of all elements has been tested on a number of device and resolutions.
All display without issue.

Devices:

•	iPhone 6/7/8

•	iPhone X

### Deployment

The site was developed using the cloud9 IDE and uses git for version control which is then pushed to GitHub. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages and deployed there from the master branch on GitHub. There is no difference between the development version of this site, and the final version hosted on GitHub Pages.
To deploy this project, I took the following initial steps:

•	From my GitHub page I clicked on 'Repositories' and selected the required repository, in this case 'second-milestone-project'

•	I then clicked on the 'settings' option, located on the top horizontal menu bar

•	Next, I scrolled down the page to the GitHub Pages section and located the dropdown box under 'Source'

•	From there I selected the 'master branch'

•	GitHub takes you back to the top of the page to allow you to rename the repository if desired. I kept it the same

•	These steps resulted in the finished site being deployed at https://spagettileg.github.io/second-milestone-project/

•	Every subsequent push to GitHub on the master branch updates the deployed site to match

***

### Credits

#### Content

•	All HTML, CSS and most of JS code was written by myself. The site was designed and built in full by myself and can be viewed via the wireframe 

•	The source dataset was obtained from kaggle website user and the specific link can be found here SERD (https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams#StudentsPerformance.csv). The process of selecting data was mainly based upon making sure the raw data was as complete as possible, with no gaps that had the potential to skew data analysis. Furthermore, the sample size of 1,000 students was considered significant in supporting meaningful analysis 

•	SpyOn() function was developed with help of Rob Gravelle's source code (https://www.htmlgoodies.com/html5/javascript/spy-on-javascript-methods-using-the-jasmine-testing-framework.html)
